brewcal - Easy homebrew tracking
=======
brewcal is a easy drag and drop calendar for tracking your homebrews.
You can signup and create your own tracking.  Each homebrew is tracked in a card in [swim lanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_lane) to quickly tell where each brew is at in the pipeline.

Description
-----------
I have been looking for a good brewing calendar for a while to plan/track my homebrews through the process. With brewcal any user can create an account, add brews into your planning queue. As you brew a new recipe, you can drag and drop the brew card through the swim lanes.   

Each calendar board will have a public url which can be sent to friends to share whats on tap or whats conditioning in bottles.

TODO
----
This project is my proposed project for the [CodeFellows](http://www.codefellows.org) evening rails workshop. Since I am adding features and working over the next 8 weeks, it will be in a constant state of flux.

### Initial Design Mockup
Below is an initial sample of the design mockup, not sure if this belongs in the README.   This was a good place to show the instructors what my thoughts are.
![Mockup](https://github.com/kevinvanderlugt/brewcal/blob/master/brewcal_mockup.png "Mockup")

Features added will be tracked in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/kevinvanderlugt/brewcal/issues)

Features
--------
* User authentication
* Drag and drop cards between brew stages
* Cards store brew title, description, link to recipe, OG and FG measurements, dates of brew and every stage past that
* Schedule/Rank brews in planning

Roadmap
-------
There is no current specified roadmap for the project. If you find an issue or feature you would like to work on, awesome!

v1.0.0 should include the following:
* User authentication
* Users can create cards (only their cards)
* Users can move cards between swim lanes
* Users can share their swimlane calendar
* Fixed swimlanes (Planning, Brewing, Fermenting, Conditioning, On Tap)
* Each brew will keep a date of when it was transferred to a new stage
* Old cards can be removed or hidden from the calendar dashboard

Would like to have:
* Shared brewing calendars between multiple users
* Private brewing calendards
