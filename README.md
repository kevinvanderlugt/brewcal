brewcal - Easy homebrew tracking
=======
brewcal is a easy drag and drop calendar for tracking your homebrews.
You can signup and create your own tracking.  Each homebrew is tracked in a card in [swim lanes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swim_lane) to quickly tell where each brew is at in the pipeline.

Description
-----------
I have been looking for a good brewing calendar for a while to plan/track my homebrews through the process. With brewcal any user can create an account, add brews into your planning queue. As you brew a new recipe, you can drag and drop the brew card through the swim lanes.   
Each calendar board will have a public url which can be sent to friends to share whats on tap or whats conditioning in bottles.
